# TileDB-CLI

TileDB-CLI is a CLI interface to the TileDB Storage Engine.

## Installation

TileDB can be installed using `pip` with:

```bash
pip install tiledb-cli
```

For development mode, in the top level directory run:

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

This will create `tiledb` (in `/usr/local/bin`, or other paths specific to `venv` or `conda` if you are using those), which you can run.
