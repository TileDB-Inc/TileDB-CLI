# TileDB-CLI

TileDB-CLI is a CLI interface to the TileDB Storage Engine.

## Installation

TileDB can be installed using `pip` with:

```bash
pip install tiledb-cli
```

For development mode, in the top level directory run:

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

This will create `/usr/local/bin/tiledb`, which you can run.
